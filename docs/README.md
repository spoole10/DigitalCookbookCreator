# ðŸ“– Digital Cookbook Creator

Welcome! This project is my senior capstone. 
# Introduction
Cherished, handwritten recipes on paper are subject to a host of problems over time, from blotches of batter, to natural deterioration which causes yellowing and brittleness. These family heirlooms may become lost in the shuffle of boxes and folders, or even to fires and natural disasters. Busy families donâ€™t have time to type these recipes into a computer for safekeeping. Digital Cookbook Creator solves these issues by allowing you to take a quick photo of each recipe. Now, your cherished recipes are always at your fingertips, whether you are at home or away.

Digital Cookbook Creator is an Android app that simplifies the process of digitizing handwritten recipes, using the power of machine learning. Simply take a picture of a treasured recipe, and Digital Cookbook Creator will format it into a digital recipe to be saved to your cookbook!
